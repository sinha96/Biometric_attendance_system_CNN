# Biometric attendance system CNN
Modern attendance System leveraging modern cutting-edge technology of Deep Learning and Convolution Neural Network

This is a early version of backend of my project.

## Problem Statement for the Project
Deploy a colud based fully automated attendance system for any purpose e.g. School, College, MNC Office, Industrial Factory etc.

## Thought process of the Project
To replace traditional attendance system which has many flaws with a better automatted system.
The existing flaws of traditional system:
  1. Takes alot of time in recording attendance of every student (specifically school/college)
  2. Proxy call among the student
  3. Punching Card passing 
    - Sometime employee passes their punching card among colleague so that they could leave office early and later system record the exit time while their colleague leaves the office
  4. Biometric fingerprint machines have storage limit of 100/200/500/1000 records only so client end up buying multiple machines.


## Resource Structure
The folder sould be like following:<br>
